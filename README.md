Welcome to the upwork task:

This is an experiment to understand the development process that data scientists follow, when solving a data science-related task.

The task requires you to solve a data science task in an interview style using Jupyter notebook and Python as a programming language. That is, you will be asked to follow a 'thinking-aloud' strategy while solving the task, sharing your thoughts and code design rationale when implementing your code. The experiment will be recorded in Skype and only used for research purposes. The video recording will not be published. 

By taking part in the experiment, you provide your consent for the recording. You will require ~ 2-3 hours in total to complete this task.

**---Instructions---**

You will be given:

* A data set
* A data science task that will require you to verify a hypothesis on the given dataset

You will need to: 

* solve the data science task implementing your code in Python, inside a Jupyter Notebook.
* develop your solution in max 90 minutes.
* avoid cleaning your code during the development time. You will have additional 30 minutes (at the end) to clean your code and produce a final version of it. We would like to specifically separate these two steps of developing and cleaning the code.
* share your thoughts while coding, and explain what you are doing and why you are doing it.
* think of multiple paths in the analysis of the data, you are allowed and encouraged to think of different forks. 

At the end of the experiment we will obtain the following things: 
* The audio & video recording of the data scientist thinking aloud while coding in screen-sharing mode
* Snapshots of the code produced by the data scientist (captured every ~2 minutes)
* The final version of the code (in a Jupyter notebook) produced by the data scientist
* Your final observations about the task and the solution produced

**Your data science task is the following:**

* Compare housing and rental prices in five major cities on the United States’ west coast. Five major cities in this task are:     Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego.

* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/zillow/zecon

* Raw data files: ‘data/data_dictionary.csv', 'data/cities_crosswalk.csv' 
  and 
  'western_states_time_series.csv' (separately provided by us)

* A description of the variables can be found in: ‘data_dictionary.csv'

* Hypothesis to be tested: “Housing and rental prices in five major cities on the United States’ west coast are correlated”.

We will share the notebook (where you can implement the solution) with you.
